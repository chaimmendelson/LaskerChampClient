so about cookies
the deal is that when the user logs in I will implement a cookie in his storage
that will be used to identify him in the future and doing that by every time he logs in I check
if the cookie is there and if it is I will redirect him to the main page and if it is not I will
redirect him to the login page where I will implemnet the cookie
therefor every page will firstly check if the user has a cookie, 
just remmeber, I control the the whole site, 
then about the socketio, probably I will connect and when I do that I will send the cookie to the server
since its better then sending the username or mabye it is not, I dont know, I will check it out
ofcourse validation will be executed on the server side
